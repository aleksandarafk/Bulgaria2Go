# Bulgaria2Go
An app, created for global audiences for my iOS Development classes
# Description

###### Concept
The concept was to showcase in a creative way, that I am able to change my app's enviroment, based on that if the device is set to the arabic language.
###### Project Idea
I have made an application that is like a tour guide. The application's name is Bulgaria2Go and as the name suggests, it has articles and locations of various popular landmarks in Bulgaria.
###### Bulgaria2Go includes
The 'Bulgaria2Go' application consists of (views):
- A featured places page(homepage)
- All articles page
- Each article has a dedicated page
- A Map page
- A Profile page

The 'Bulgaria2Go' application consists of (functions):
- Design made for dark and light mode
- Enviroment changes if your device's language is arabic
- Translation (English, Bulgarian, Dutch and Arabic) 
- A map(integrated in the details page), showcasing the location for each different landmark in my app 
- A map that has a preset destination, that shows the user the directions
### Used technologies
The application was fully coded in SwiftUI. The application is available for devices with iOS version 16.1 and up.

NOTE: You should own an Apple device (MacBook, Mac mini, iMac) in order to access the files using Xcode.

Clone the repository on your machine and simply open the Bulgaria2Go.xcodeproj file. Everything should work from there.
